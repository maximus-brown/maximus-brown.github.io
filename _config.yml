  author__bio: A newbie to the crypto space, I discovered Cardano early on in my journey while researching how to mint my own NFTs as an artist and creator. Along the way I started to look at other people's projects and I was amazed of all the creativity being put into each one. And that's how Explore CNFTs was born!
