The recent surge in popularity of ETH games like [Axie Affinity](https://axieinfinity.com) and [My Defi Pet](https://mydefipet.com) could be a telling sign of what's to come with new games being developed on Cardano.  

Axie Affinity was partially inspired by the Pokemon universe and they're currently hot! As of right now Axie Affinity is currently ranked #1 for daily, weekly, and monthly active users for ETH games. 

## Play to Earn
One of the key differences between traditional games we've played in the past versus new ones built on top of blockchains is the ability for people around the world to actually earn new income streams for playing games. This is no joke and the term is dubbed "Play-to-Earn". 

Axie Affinity has changed peoples lives in developing countries like in the Philippines. During COVID-19 when most places were shut down  people of all ages were learning how to earn income playing this game. 

## Breeding
Being able to create and breed new characters on the blockchain that you own and can sell on the marketplace seems like fun entertainment, but imagine in the future developers creating educational games where students could enjoy learning and in turn if they pass certain levels of the course they could earn rewards as NFTs that can be kept in their wallet.

As of right now educational games on blockchains are limited, but I think that's going to change soon with Cardano after the release of Alonzo for smart contracts. Gas fees on Etherium are still too expensive at the moment. Maybe things will change with ETH 2.0, but that might be a year away. 

## How about "Play to Learn"?
I'm super excited about the future of blockchain games and even more excited when I see creators build educational games that can be dubbe "Play to Learn" rather than just "Play to Earn".

We're going to get there someday in my opinion!

Until next time, take care!
