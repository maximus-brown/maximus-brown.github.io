A newbie to the crypto space, I discovered Cardano early on in my journey while researching how to mint my own NFTs as an artist and creator. Along the way I started to look at other people's projects and I was amazed of all the creativity being put into each one. 

I soon came to the conclusion that there needs to be a centralized place where newbies like myself could go to learn about new projects built on top of blockchains like Cardano and updates to existing projects. And that's how Explore NFTs was born!  

The focus will fully be around Cardano projects that are creating CNFTs, adding utility, and hopefully soon exploring some amazing new Metaverse worlds after smart contracts are live. I'm super excited about the future of Cardano and I want to be a part of it in some small way.
