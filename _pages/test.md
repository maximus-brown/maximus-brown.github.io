Creativity in new projects keeps on coming! [@CardanoTrees](https://twitter.com/CardanoTrees) has built the first on-chain trees living and growing in Cardano Blockchain. Yes, that's right. All code and art is written on the blockchain entirely and the art itself dynamically changes over time.  

## Demo Tree
Before we dive further into the project I highly recommend watching the animatated [demo](https://pool.pm/386707e1dd9ae353a49480c576a680266e48737be00c1515ec3e715d.CTDemo04) on Pool.pm in the link shared below. 

This demo tree has super accelerated growth to show the evolution, but the actual CNFTs in the future will move at a much slower pace. Not only that, each tree has a set of geographic coordinates that behave based on the time of day the coordinates are located around the world.

Simply beautiful right! I was struggling to put into words all aspects of this masterpiece. Showing only static images of the project wouldn't do justice to the full experience of the art. 

Below are some tree designs he's working on for an upcoming CNFT drop that hasn't been announced yet.

## Seasons and Weather Conditions
Not only do these NFTs change based on time of day, but also times of the year with seasonality. Rain and thunder clouds, snow, snowflakes, and more. I love it! And it's all stored in 4KB of code.

## Each point in time is never the same
At any given point in time the NFT changes and will never be the same. Sometimes you might see flowers, fruits, or even see the tree shrink based on seasons. They live on the blockchain forever. 

## Real trees will be planted for each minted CNFT
For each CNFT minted there will be a real tree planted in the world. I love this idea and we desperately need more projects like this!

## Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain
I couldn't have said this better about the efficience of Cardano's blockchain technology. Damain's quote is below.

> Because Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain, it's a beautiful place to growth nature in it!!!

## Conclusion 
In summary, what's quite unique about this project is they aren't static images, gifs, or videos. These trees are growing on the fly and entirely stored as code on the blockchain. That means hosting art files to reference in IPFS, but the artist did include that information in case anyone wanted to take a look



This demo tree has super accelerated growth to show the evolution to anxious people!


Because Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain :heart_eyes: , is a beautiful place to growth nature in it!!! :rainbow: 

Using generative art techniques, the whole tree that evolve and live forever are generated with only 4KB code :nerd: . Due to the small size code, it is possible to mint it fully onchain!!
Because our mission is to make a greener world :earth_americas: :recycle: , a real tree will be planted for each CardanoTree minted!!! 
There will be a CardanoTree associated with each point in the worldmap and you will see how the world becomes greener with each CT minted!!!

In addition, the position on the map will determine the day/night cycles, weather conditions in different seasons, rain and snow, etc...
Different species of trees are emerging! All of them growing up in Cardano!

CardanoTrees can be used like a live art picture on the TV!! Because is generated on the fly always uses all the resolution available in the device where you display it!!!

Playing with the CardanoTree on the TV like a live art picture!!

Generated with only 3.5KB of code that is fully onchain!!! Always uses all the resolution available in the device where you display it!!!

What do you think!?!? 

Leave your comments below and stay tuned!!


Here are the first five Cardano trees that I have already minted and giveaway. I include an ipfs link to people that prefer that but as you say all is in the blockchain and generated on the fly (is an html and js code).


yes, is all in the blockchain. and the thumbnail is in the blockchain too... is an svg code (suport vercor graphic). For example you can see here...
