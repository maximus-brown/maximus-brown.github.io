Creativity in new projects keeps on coming! [@CardanoTrees](https://twitter.com/CardanoTrees) has built the first on-chain trees living and growing in Cardano Blockchain. Yes, that's right. All code and art is written on the blockchain entirely and the art itself dynamically changes over time.  

## Demo Tree
Before we dive further into the project I highly recommend watching the animatated demo on Pool.pm in the link shared below. 

This demo tree has super accelerated growth to show the evolution, but the actual CNFTs in the future will move at a much slower pace. 

[View Demo Here](https://pool.pm/386707e1dd9ae353a49480c576a680266e48737be00c1515ec3e715d.CTDemo04)

Simply beautiful right! I was struggling to put into words all aspects of this masterpiece. 

Below are some tree designs he's working on for an upcoming CNFT drop that hasn't been announced yet.

## Seasons and Weather Conditions

## Only 4KB of code

## Real trees will be planted for each minted CNFT





Know the fist full on-chain trees living and growing in Cardano Blockchain!! Deciduous treeDizzy symbol

CardanoTrees are the first full on-chain trees living and growing in Cardano Blockchain!! :deciduous_tree: :rainbow: 
They are not static images, gifs or videos... they are trees growing on the fly based on time!!
They growth, give flowers :sunflower:  or fruits :kiwi: , shrinks in some season and growth again!! Never are the same and they live forever!!
They experience different weather conditions... rain  :thunder_cloud_rain: :umbrella:   snow :cloud_snow: :snowflake: :snowman2: 
This demo tree has super accelerated growth to show the evolution to anxious people!


Because Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain :heart_eyes: , is a beautiful place to growth nature in it!!! :rainbow: 
Using generative art techniques, the whole tree that evolve and live forever are generated with only 4KB code :nerd: . Due to the small size code, it is possible to mint it fully onchain!!
Because our mission is to make a greener world :earth_americas: :recycle: , a real tree will be planted for each CardanoTree minted!!! 
There will be a CardanoTree associated with each point in the worldmap and you will see how the world becomes greener with each CT minted!!!

In addition, the position on the map will determine the day/night cycles, weather conditions in different seasons, rain and snow, etc...
Different species of trees are emerging! All of them growing up in Cardano!

CardanoTrees can be used like a live art picture on the TV!! Because is generated on the fly always uses all the resolution available in the device where you display it!!!

Playing with the CardanoTree on the TV like a live art picture!!

Generated with only 3.5KB of code that is fully onchain!!! Always uses all the resolution available in the device where you display it!!!

What do you think!?!? 

Leave your comments below and stay tuned!!


Here are the first five Cardano trees that I have already minted and giveaway. I include an ipfs link to people that prefer that but as you say all is in the blockchain and generated on the fly (is an html and js code).


yes, is all in the blockchain. and the thumbnail is in the blockchain too... is an svg code (suport vercor graphic). For example you can see here...
