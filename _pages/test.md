Cardano based creator, artist, and contributor Reiko from the Philippines is quite the busy bee. It's easy to see her genuine passion with being involved in the Cardano community across several projects. Outside of the crypto world she's also a Dentistry student who loves animals, surfing, nature, traveling, games, and making new friends across the world. 

As I'm writing this article I'm certain there are things I'm missing in her contributions to help make Earth a better place, but I'd to share about one special project in particular she cofounded in March 2021 with Mr. Wolf called "isladiwa". The team has now grown to eight and includes talented artists, developers, and writers.

The artists on the team are creating amazing work like the one piece above called Bukang-Liwayway. These beautiful art pieces are minted as NFTs and proceeds are used to support some very important initiatives including the PAWSsion Project and BAYANInitiatives.

In fact, isladiwa was originally created to help support these two initiatives.

The name isladiwa was derived from the words “isla” meaning island, and “diwa”, meaning soul, spirit, and sense. With these words combined, isladiwa alludes to the island of souls.



What are you most excited about in the CNFT space in the next 5 years?

I'm excited for CNFTs integrated with smart contracts, use cases, functionality. To see CNFT creators who put so much hardwork and passion to their craft bear fruits. Also so excited  to see what isladiwa does in the next 5 years and the amount of community it helped.


What is one thing you enjoy about being involved and active in Cardano related projects?


What are you hoping NFT projects as a whole will accomplish in the world longer term?


Sustainablility, a creative diverse community. Better environment for artists and collectors abolish fraud, inequality. People really just enjoying the art backed by blockchain

Treasuring precious friendships that I have made and still continuing to make. To see people who enjoy art and seeing that it change their lives








 put into words how much she's positively contributed to the community a better place as I've continued to learn about her contributions as I've

Her involvement in the Cardano community stretches far and wide. And outside of crypto she's 

I’m ReiKo, a 22 year old Dentistry student from PH who loves animals, traveling, games, nature, surfing, and making friends all over the globe. I started the isladiwa Discord server with the help of Mr. Wolf and got further involved with my love for learning/exploring art and crypto. I’m glad I came across Cardano that I resonate so much with its vision and goals.



Not only has she built her own diverse community space on Discord






















Until next time, take care!
