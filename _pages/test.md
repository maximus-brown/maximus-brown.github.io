Cardano based creator, artist, and contributor [Reiko](https://twitter.com/isladiwa) from the Philippines is quite the busy bee. It's easy to see her genuine passion with being involved in the Cardano community across several projects.

Outside of the crypto world she's also a Dentistry student who loves animals, surfing, nature, traveling, games, and making new friends across the world. 

As I'm writing this article I'm certain there are things I'm missing in her contributions to help make Earth a better place, but I'd to share about one special project in particular she cofounded in March 2021 with [Mr. Wolf](https://www.instagram.com/wolf.tiu) called [isladiwa](https://isladiwa.org/). The team has now grown to eight and includes talented artists, developers, and writers.

The artists and entire team behind the scenes are creating amazing work like the one piece above called Bukang-Liwayway in the Pearl of the Orient collection. I greatly enjoyed watching the animated version on Pool.pm [here](https://pool.pm/0b28027fdb48b5f7f97e8c93e5939bc85eb9f0e7fe93e354672ce67d.PearlOfTheOrient01)! 

These beautiful art pieces are minted as [NFTs](https://isladiwa.org/cnft-sale/) and proceeds are used to support some very important initiatives including the [PAWSsion Project](https://pawssionproject.org.ph/) and BAYANInitiatives.

The [PAWSsion Project](https://pawssionproject.org.ph/) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and rehoming of dogs in distress.

In fact, isladiwa was originally created to help support these two initiatives I mentioned above and birthed as a [Discord community](https://discord.gg/ttZGnwHD).

Growing up as a kid I've personally seen and experienced how special it is to adopt a dog when our family decided to take one home to be a part of the family. He was a cute little puppy named Corki that ultimately lived a long and happy life. The first day he was so excited that someone picked him to be a part of a home, but it took some time for him to be reassured it wasn't temporary. It was a special day and I'm thrilled to see organizations like isladiwa and the PAWSsion Project try to help dogs in need live a better life. 

The isladiwa organization also helps share about other local artists in the Philippines like this one from [@OlieMerza](https://twitter.com/OlieMerza).

Their main artist Ghyllian Delfin and her work is brilliant!

## Q&A Session with ReiKo
On a different note, ReiKo was kind enough to answer a few questions I had.

What are you most excited about in the CNFT space in the next 5 years?

> I'm excited for CNFTs integrated with smart contracts, use cases, functionality. To see CNFT creators who put so much hardwork and passion to their craft bear fruits. Also so excited  to see what isladiwa does in the next 5 years and the amount of community it helped.

What is one thing you enjoy about being involved and active in Cardano related projects?

> Treasuring precious friendships that I have made and still continuing to make. To see people who enjoy art and seeing that it change their lives

What are you hoping NFT projects as a whole will accomplish in the world longer term?

> Sustainablility, a creative diverse community. Better environment for artists and collectors abolish fraud, inequality. People really just enjoying the art backed by blockchain

Well, that wraps up my story of ReiKo and the exciting new journey she's started creating isladiwa and riding the wave of Cardano. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this article and supporting good causes like this. 

Until next time, take care!
