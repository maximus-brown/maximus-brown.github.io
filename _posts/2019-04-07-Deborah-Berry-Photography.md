The term "High Speed Macro Photography" was entirely unknown to me until I discovered a collection of CNFTs launched by [Deborah Berry Photography](https://www.deborahberryphotography.com/).

She started creating high speed liquid art during a local photography club competition between men and women on the subject "water drops". 

After she spent some time during the contest to research this type of photography she decided to give it a try.

Here's a picture of her first set up and humble beginning.

Imagine all the complexities involved to capture a still frame of a water splash in roughly 10,000th of a second that looks as clean and mesmerizing as her art piece shown below. It took her four hours to capture her first collision.

She ended up winning best in show in the competition with the image shown above and falling in love with not knowing what you're going to get next. 

Each experiment is unique and can sometimes take 500-800 shots to get to a high quality art piece.

> It's exciting to see how the colors mix and stretch.  The liquid is colored before taking the capture and it's captured one shot at a time.  

Oh, and before I forget. The women ended up winning the overall competition! Congrats to all of you.

## Challenges during Covid
Deborah was in several art galleries and doing Fine Art shows during the winter months througout the State of Florida until Covid hit and that's when pretty much everything shut down including art shows.  

> During Covid my husband was forced to shut down his business also. The last two years have been really hard.  

She also unfortunately broke her femur during this time and had surgery immediately after the following day. To this day she's still not able to walk without a cane and even with it can't walk very far. 

### NFTs gave her a renewed spirit
Her son told her to look into doing NFT's to generate a source of income. Of course she didn't even know what that was, but she kept pushing forward to learn more about it. 

She started researching and then came across a free webinar done by Jason Matias in which he taught about the art business and NFT's. 

## A new begnning emerged
In October of 2021 she created a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DeborahBerryPic) that now has over 1,600 followers, and started to listen and learn until she finally got up the nerve to start asking questions.  

She went to many spaces across blockchains and ended up finding a connection with the Cardano Community. 

> They made me feel at home.  I was amazed at how friendly and helpful everyone was.  

She felt like this endeavor was like learning a whole new language and in all reality it is.

> My biggest challenge was that I had no funds to start with but then I was given a challenge once again. 

She was told by Jason Matias that if she got a wallet by midnight he would give her 50 ADA.  
> At first I tried to download one wallet but it was taking forever so then I found another and made the deadline with him saying I didn't think you were going to make it.  

Here's a few more examples of her art I really like.

## Minting  
Then there's the huge hurdle of learning how to mint and market her work. Minting NFTs for the first time is a beast of it's own and I admire Deborah's dedication to learn how to do this. 

There was a time when she was overwhelmed with the processes involved and when she was about to give up [@flawwed1Art](https://twitter.com/flawwed1Art) took her under his wing and encouraged her to keep going.  

## Her first NFT drop was a success
After countless hours of hard work Deborah was finally able to launch her first collection on Nov 23, 2021 just over a month after joining twitter. 

Her first CNFT collection is amazing!

She envisioned using this drop as a way to introduce her work and herself to the community.  
> It was exciting to see how much the community loved my work.  I'm just over 65% sold out now and I look forward to bringing more liquid art drops to the community.  

Her favorite thing is showing others the hidden beauty that can't be seen by the naked eye. 

## Now onto releasing her second CNFT collection
She then got inspired to take her original waterdrop images and process them to create entirely new art and ulitimately led her to create a second collection of CNFTs called the Sweetheart Collection for Valentines Day.

Here's a closer look at one of them.

Keep your eyes peeled on her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeborahBerryPic) account and [Discord](https://discord.gg/hyPxMN4N) server for upcoming announcements on this and future developments!

## Co-Host of Cardano Women and Cardano Nights
Not only is she working diligently on her own collection, she's also giving back to the community by co-hosting both [Cardano Women](https://www.adacafe.io/cardano-women) and Cardano Mic Nights that's supported by [ADA Cafe](https://www.adacafe.io/). 

Quite the busy woman! 

## Last but not least thank you
I want to personally thank Deborah for her time to share with me her wonderful story and being patient with me during a period of time when I took a break from writing articles. 

Wishing you all the best in your future work and inspirations in the NFTs space, and with life.
