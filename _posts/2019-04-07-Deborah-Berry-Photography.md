The term "High Speed Macro Photography" was an entirely new term to me until I discovered [Deborah Berry's Photography](https://www.deborahberryphotography.com/) after she launched a collection of CNFTs.

She started creating high speed liquid art during a local photography club competition between men and women on the subject "water drops". 

After she spent some time researching this type of photography during the contest she decided to give it a try.

Here's a picture of her humble beginning of her first set up.

Imagine all the complexities involved to capture a still frame of a water splash in roughly 10,000th of a second that looks as clean and beautiful as her art piece shown below. It took her four hours to capture her first collision.

She ended up winning best in show in the competition with the image shown above and falling in love with not know what you're going to get next. 

Each experiment is unique and can sometimes take 500-800 shots to get to high quality art piece.

> It's exciting to see how the colors mix and stretch.  The liquid is colored before taking the capture and it's captured one shot at a time.  

Oh, and yes the women ended up winning the overall competition too. 


## Challenges during Covid
Deborah's was in several art galleries and doing Fine Art shows during the winter througout the State of Florida until Covid hit and shut pretty much all of the shows down. 

> During Covid my husband was forced to shut down his business also. The last two years have been really hard.  

Her son told her to look into doing NFT's to generate a source of income. Of course she didn't even know what that was, but she kept pushing forward to learn more about it. 

She started researching and then came across a free webinar done by Jason Matias in which he taught about the art business and NFT's. 

## A new begnning emerged
In October of 2021 she created a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DeborahBerryPic) that now has over 1,600 followers, and started to listen and learn until she finally got up the nerve to start asking questions.  

She went to many spaces but found a connection with the Cardano Community. 

> They made me feel at home.  I was amazed at how friendly and helpful everyone was.  

She felt like this endeavor was like learning a whole new language.

> My biggest challenge was that I had no funds to start with but then I was given a challenge once again. 

She was told by Jason Matias that if she got a wallet by midnight he would give her 50 ADA.  
> At first I tried to download one wallet but it was taking forever so then I found another and made the deadline with him saying I didn't think you were going to make it.  

Here's another one of her art pieces I really like.

## Minting  
Then there's the huge hurdel of learning how to mint and market her work. For those that have been in the NFT space we know minting is a beast of it's own. This is not an easy piece to learn and perfect, and I admire Deborah's dedication to learn how to do this. 

> There was a time when I was overwhelmed and was going to give up but then [@flawwed1Art](https://twitter.com/flawwed1Art) took me under his wing and encouraged me to keep going.  


## Her first drop
After countless hours of hard work Deborah finally did her introduction drop on Nov 23, 2021 just over a month after joining twitter.  

My thought was to use this drop as a way to introduce my work and myself to the community.  It was exciting to see how much the community loved my work.  I'm just over 50% sold now and look forward to bringing more liquid art drops to the community.  I think in the future I would do more of limited editions and possibly even doing some one of one auctions.  No definite plans yet.  My favorite thing is showing others the hidden beauty that can't be seen by the naked eye. 




To take it a step further she then needed to learn
