The term "High Speed Macro Photography" was entirely new to me until I discovered a new collection of CNFTs launched by [Deborah Berry's Photography](https://www.deborahberryphotography.com/).

She started creating high speed liquid art during a local photography club competition between men and women on the subject "water drops". 

After she spent some time during the contest to research this type of photography she decided to give it a try.

Here's a picture of her first set up and humble beginning.

Imagine all the complexities involved to capture a still frame of a water splash in roughly 10,000th of a second that looks as clean and mesmerizing as her art piece shown below. It took her four hours to capture her first collision.

She ended up winning best in show in the competition with the image shown above and falling in love with not know what you're going to get next. 

Each experiment is unique and can sometimes take 500-800 shots to get to a high quality art piece.

> It's exciting to see how the colors mix and stretch.  The liquid is colored before taking the capture and it's captured one shot at a time.  

Oh, before I forget...the answer is yes the women ended up winning the overall competition! Congrats to all of you.

## Challenges during Covid
Deborah was in several art galleries and doing Fine Art shows during the winter months througout the State of Florida until Covid hit and that's when pretty much everything shut down including art shows.  

> During Covid my husband was forced to shut down his business also. The last two years have been really hard.  

Unfortunately during this time she also broke her hip and became very ill for 7 weeks that ultimately put her in a bad depression. It's an understatement to say how difficult it was for her during this time.

### NFTs gave her a renewed spirit
Her son told her to look into doing NFT's to generate a source of income. Of course she didn't even know what that was, but she kept pushing forward to learn more about it. 

She started researching and then came across a free webinar done by Jason Matias in which he taught about the art business and NFT's. 

## A new begnning emerged
In October of 2021 she created a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/DeborahBerryPic) that now has over 1,600 followers, and started to listen and learn until she finally got up the nerve to start asking questions.  

She went to many spaces on different blockchains and ended up finding a connection with the Cardano Community. 

> They made me feel at home.  I was amazed at how friendly and helpful everyone was.  

She felt like this endeavor was like learning a whole new language.

> My biggest challenge was that I had no funds to start with but then I was given a challenge once again. 

She was told by Jason Matias that if she got a wallet by midnight he would give her 50 ADA.  
> At first I tried to download one wallet but it was taking forever so then I found another and made the deadline with him saying I didn't think you were going to make it.  

Here's another one of her art pieces I really like.

## Minting  
Then there's the huge hurdle of learning how to mint and market her work. Minting NFTs for the first time is a beast of it's own and I admire Deborah's dedication to learn how to do this. 

There was a time when she was overwhelmed and about to give up but then [@flawwed1Art](https://twitter.com/flawwed1Art) took me under his wing and encouraged me to keep going.  


## Her first drop
After countless hours of hard work Deborah finally did her introduction drop on Nov 23, 2021 just over a month after joining twitter. 

Her first CNFT collection is amazing!

My thought was to use this drop as a way to introduce my work and myself to the community.  It was exciting to see how much the community loved my work.  I'm just over 50% sold now and look forward to bringing more liquid art drops to the community.  I think in the future I would do more of limited editions and possibly even doing some one of one auctions.  No definite plans yet.  My favorite thing is showing others the hidden beauty that can't be seen by the naked eye. 




## Second CNFT Collection
I took my original waterdrop image and processed and created a whole new art
FYI....I use the waterdrop images o create the new art

You may want to listen in on my artist spotlight interview tonight at 7pm est time. 

I did forget to mention in my history about breaking my hip in March and becoming very ill for 7 weeks which put me in a bad depression. I still can walk without a cane now and doing nft's has giving me a renewed spirit
