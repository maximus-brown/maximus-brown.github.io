The term "High Speed Macro Photography" was an entirely new term to me until I discovered [Deborah Berry's photography](https://www.deborahberryphotography.com/) after she launched a CNFTs project. She started creating high speed liquid art during a local photography club competition between men and women on the subject "water drops".

After researching this type of photography for the competition she decided to give it a try. Here's an image of her humble beginning of her first set up.

Imagine all the complexities involved to capture a water splash that looks as clean and beautiful as this in a split moment of time. She's capturing these water splashes in roughly 10,000th of a second.

Oh, and before I forget the answer is yes...the women won the competition in her local photography club.
