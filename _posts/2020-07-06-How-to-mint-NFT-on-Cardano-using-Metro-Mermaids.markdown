As I'm writing this article I realize the process of minting NFTs on Cardano blockchain is going to changed dramatically in the near future after the official release of smart contracts with [Alonzo Goguen](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/), but at the very least it might help a few folks eager to get started right away and perhaps be a part of history.

Now, you might be wondering how is it even possible to mint NFTs on Cardano when smart contracts aren't yet available. The short answer is developers have figured out a way to hack together methods to make it work and some of the earliest NFT projects like with [Spacebudz](https://spacebudz.io) were hugely successful selling out supply in a matter of days.

[Here's](https://cardano-ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/faq.html#cardano-native-tokens-vs-erc) a more technical explanation coming straight from Cardano's website. 

Today I'll share one of the easiest and quickest ways to mint your own NFT in a matter of minutes using a simple tool built by Metro Mermaids.
