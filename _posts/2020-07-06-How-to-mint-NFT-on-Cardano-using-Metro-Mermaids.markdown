As I'm writing this article I realize the process of minting NFTs on Cardano blockchain is going to change dramatically in the near future after the official release of smart contracts with [Alonzo Goguen](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/), but at the very least it might help a few folks eager to get started right away that want to be a part of history.

Now, you might be wondering how is it even possible to mint NFTs on Cardano when smart contracts aren't yet available. The short answer is developers have figured out a way to hack together methods to make it work and some of the earliest NFT projects like with [Spacebudz](https://spacebudz.io) were hugely successful selling out supply in a matter of days.

A more technical explanation can be seen straight from [Cardano's website.](https://cardano-ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/faq.html#cardano-native-tokens-vs-erc) 

Today I'll share one of the easiest and quickest ways to mint your own NFT in a matter of minutes using a simple tool built by [Metro Mermaids.](https://www.metromermaids.com)

# Let's get started!

### Step 1: Upload your image to IPFS
Since this is your first time ever minting an NFT, find an image that you're completely fine with messing up on and uploading to a place that everyone has access to see. Once images are uploaded to [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/) there's no turning back and they can't be deleted!

I'd also suggest being VERY careful what type of image you're uploading to ensure you don't break any copyright infringements.  

We're going to use a platform called [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) to upload images to IPFS, which has been my favorite tool so far. I'm currently using their free tier plan. There are certainly other options if you're inclined to use alternatives. 

### Let's go to Pinata:

After creating an account and logging in you should see an Upload button at the top center of the page. Click on the Upload button.

A popup window should appear that looks like this:

Upload your image and wait a few seconds until complete. I just used the image created for this tutorial. You should now see your image displayed kind of like this.
