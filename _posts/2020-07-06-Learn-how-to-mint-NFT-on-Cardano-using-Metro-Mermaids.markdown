The process of minting NFTs on Cardano blockchain is most likely going to change dramatically in the near future after the official release of smart contracts with [Alonzo Goguen](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/), but that could still be at least a few months away. 

In the meantime there are going to be folks like me who want to start minting NFTs right away to be a part of history and early adopters in this exciting new space. 

One of the easiest and quickest ways to mint your own NFT in a matter of minutes is using a simple tool built by [MetroMermaids.](https://www.metromermaids.com)  

Feel free to check them out on Twitter! [@_mermada](https://twitter.com/_mermada)

Initially I started to put together my own step by step guide on how to mint NFTs, but [Crypto Slim's](https://youtu.be/YPvrfV4dkbM) video tutorial already does a fantastic job explaining all the steps involved and the link is shown below.

Separately, here's a link to MermADA's minting tool so you have that handy for the video.

### How is it possible to mint NFTs on Cardano without smart contracts?
Now, you might be wondering how is it even possible to mint NFTs on Cardano when smart contracts aren't yet available. The short answer is developers have figured out a way to hack together methods to make it work and some of the earliest NFT projects like [Spacebudz](https://spacebudz.io) were hugely successful selling out supply in a matter of days.

A more technical explanation of how minting NFTs is possible right now can be seen straight from [Cardano's website.](https://cardano-ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/faq.html#cardano-native-tokens-vs-erc) 

Good luck and best wishes on your journey with Cardano! I've been pleasantly surprised with how warm and supportive the community has been helping each other.
