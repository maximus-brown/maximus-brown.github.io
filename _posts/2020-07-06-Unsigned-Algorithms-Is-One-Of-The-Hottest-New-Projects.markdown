One of the hottest projects right now is [unsigned_algorithms](https://www.unsigs.com/). Sizzling hot! So far almost all of the NFTs minted on Cardano use external image URLs hosted on IPFS as the art source, which basically means that the actual art itself is not written on the blockchain.

That's changed with unsigned_algorithms. They're actually minting all Python code on the blockchain that generates every single art piece minted in the collection.

There will be a little over 31,115 unique art pieces in the collection if it's completely sold out and as I'm writing this article only 6,936 left. That's quite impressive. 

It gets even more interesting when hopping onto their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nQUJefNq) to
see how active and passionate the community is, and learn more about the spinoff projects created purely by being inspired from the original unsigned_algorithms project. 

One example is project called [UnsigShop of Wonder.](https://unsigshop.com/)

> "This shop is made up of many Unsig Owners and acts as a way for those that have invested in the project to sell products that contain their unsigs. Right now it is pure based Unsigs but I am hoping for wonderful creations to explode from the creative minds of these individuals and be offered here to all to buy."
