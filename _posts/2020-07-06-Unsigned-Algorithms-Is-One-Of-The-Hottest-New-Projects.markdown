One of the hottest projects right now is [unsigned_algorithms](https://www.unsigs.com/). Sizzling hot! So far almost all of the NFTs minted on Cardano use external image URLs hosted on IPFS as the art source, which basically means that the actual art itself is not written on the blockchain.

That's changed with unsigned_algorithms. They're actually minting all Python code on the blockchain that generates every single art piece minted in the collection. Not only that they've created a public Github repo sharing all the code for anyone to use and learn.

There will be a little over 31,115 unique art pieces in the collection if it's completely sold out and as I'm writing this article only 6,936 left. That's quite impressive. 

It gets even more interesting when hopping onto their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nQUJefNq](https://discord.gg/nQUJefNq) to
see how active and passionate the community is, and learn more about the spinoff projects created purely by being inspired from the original unsigned_algorithms project.
