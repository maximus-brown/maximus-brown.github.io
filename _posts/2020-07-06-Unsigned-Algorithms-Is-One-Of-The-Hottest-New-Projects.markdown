One of the hottest projects right now is [unsigned_algorithms](https://www.unsigs.com/). Sizzling hot! So far almost all of the NFTs minted across several projects on Cardano use external image URLs hosted on IPFS as the art source, which basically means that the actual art itself is not written on the blockchain.

That's changed with unsigned_algorithms. They're actually minting all Python code on the blockchain that generates every single art piece in the collection.

There will be a total of 31,115 unique art pieces in the collection if it's completely sold out and as I'm writing this article there are only 6,936 left. That's quite impressive. 

### Spinoff Projects
It gets even more interesting when hopping onto their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nQUJefNq) to
see how active and passionate the community is. I started diving into some of the spinoff projects created purely based on being inspired from the original unsigned_algorithms project. 

One example is project called [UnsigShop of Wonder.](https://unsigshop.com/)

> "This shop is made up of many Unsig Owners and acts as a way for those that have invested in the project to sell products that contain their unsigs. Right now it is pure based Unsigs but I am hoping for wonderful creations to explode from the creative minds of these individuals and be offered here to all to buy."

There are several other spinoff projects starting up, I've only shared one.

### Active on Twitter
One of the best ways to see what they're up to is to visit them on Twitter. [@unsigned_algo](https://twitter.com/unsigned_algo)

Now that they've gotten a big boost in funding from their first art collection drop, it's very possible they have more plans ahead to make it even better. Should be intereseting to follow. 

Until next time take care!
