Space, galaxies, and planets have always been something I've been fascinated with at a young age, yet I still know so little. When I stumbled across the [@DexoWorlds](https://twitter.com/DexoWorlds) project, which was built on top of the Cardano blockchain, I was intrigued because each one of the pixel art NFTs was a unique planet in a fictional galaxy called Veran Way.

Each one of the 11,081 individual planets also have various properties like color schemes, patterns, rings, moons, life, and more. 

For example, planet [#2108](https://pool.pm/862cd06c4504de6114a29e0b863751ee84ad455493d43aeeb727d896.DexoWorld2108) shown above, also called "Ekexdoporos-a", has loads of different properties including: 

- Background Start Color || white
- Compositions || Rocky 
- Host Star ID|| 479
- Host Star Name || Ekexdoporos

Until next time, take care!
