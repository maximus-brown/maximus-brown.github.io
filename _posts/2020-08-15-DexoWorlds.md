Space, galaxies, and planets have always been something I've been fascinated with since a young age, yet I still know so little. 

When I stumbled across [@DexoWorlds](https://twitter.com/DexoWorlds) NFT project, which was built on top of the Cardano blockchain, I was intrigued because each one of the pixel art pieces that could be collected was a unique planet in a fictional galaxy called *Veran Way* and I liked that it could inspire people of all ages to learn more about science.

Individal planets have various properties like color schemes, patterns, rings, moons, life, and more. 

For example, planet [#2108](https://pool.pm/862cd06c4504de6114a29e0b863751ee84ad455493d43aeeb727d896.DexoWorld2108) shown above, also called "Ekexdoporos-a", has loads of different properties including: 

- Background Start Color : White

### Future Plans
Creators of the project are astrophysics students and they envision implementing loads of cool features in the future once smart contracts are supported on Cardano. 

A few ideas they have in mind include ways to facilitate trading and distributing new NFTs of each star to those who hold all of the planets which orbit that star


Until next time, take care!
