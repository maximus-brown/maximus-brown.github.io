Space, galaxies, and planets have always been something I've been fascinated with since a young age, yet I still know so little. 

When I stumbled across [@DexoWorlds](https://twitter.com/DexoWorlds) NFT project, which was built on top of the Cardano blockchain, I was intrigued because each one of the pixel art pieces that could be collected was a unique planet in a fictional galaxy called *Veran Way*. 

I also liked that it could inspire people of all ages to learn more about science and the simplicity of the art itself.

Individal planets have various properties like color schemes, patterns, rings, moons, life, and more. 

For example, planet [#2108](https://dexoworlds.com/worlds/2108) shown above, also called "Ekexdoporos-a", has loads of different properties including: 

- Compositions : Rocky 
- Host Star Name : Ekexdoporos
- Life : None
- Moons : 1
- Planet Position : 1/6
- Region : Nether Arm
- Research Impact : Interesting
- Rings : Normal
- Rings Color : Special 
- Total Satellites : 4
- And more...

To get the full experience of this planet you can check it out on their website in the link below.

### Future Plans
Creators of the project are astrophysics students and they envision implementing loads of cool features in the future once smart contracts are supported on the Cardano blockchain with the hard Alonzo fork.  

A few ideas they have in mind include ways to facilitate trading and distributing new NFTs of each star to those who hold all of the planets which orbit that star.

> Our ultimate goal is to create generative art on the Cardano blockchain.

### Is there actual science involved here?
The best explanation for this comes straight from the creators. 

> Yes! Well, some. The concept of DexoWorlds is based upon the scientific field of Exoplanet Searches and Characterization. The types of stars you can find, including their properties (like mass, surface temperature, color, etc.) are all based on what you might actually find in a typical spiral galaxy. In addition, the locations of the planets around these stars determine if conditions are right for there to be liquid water and potentially life on each planet. In terms of the colors, rings, and moons, well, we took some artistic liberties. In all, DexoWorlds are 50% science and 50% art!

### Q&A : What is one thing you're most excited about in the future for the Cardano community?

> I'm most excited about the release of smart contracts slated for less than a month from now, which will add a whole new level of creativity and versatility to the ecosystem. It's incredible to see what artists and developers have already been able to achieve on Cardano, so I can only imagine what's going to come next!

### How can I learn more about DexoWorlds? 
One of the best ways to see what the DexoWorlds team is up to is visit  their active Discord community or reach out to them on Twitter. I've provided links to both below.
