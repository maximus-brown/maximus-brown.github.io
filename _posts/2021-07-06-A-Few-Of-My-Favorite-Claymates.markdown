[Claymates](https://www.claymates.org) is by far one of my favorite projects so far because of the uniqueness put into each of the cute stop motion figures and characters, their low minted rarities, and how engaged the project creators are in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/8HpNU9Q9) community. 

I also like that they continue to surprise art collectors for new drops released with something entirely new and unexpected. 

For example, they recently announced they've been working on a collaboration project with [Spacebudz](https://spacebudz.io/) and the first drop for a handful of these Spacebudz characters is scheduled to be on Saturday, July 17th.
