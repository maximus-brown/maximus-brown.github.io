[Claymates](https://www.claymates.org) is by far one of my favorite projects so far because of the uniqueness put into each of the cute stop motion figures and characters, their low minted rarities, and how engaged the project creators are in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/8HpNU9Q9) community. 

I also like that they continue to surprise art collectors for new drops released with something entirely new and unexpected. For example, the newest announcement is they've been working on a collaboration project with [Spacebudz](https://spacebudz.io/) and they're releasing a set up new NFTs for a narrowed down group of Spacebudz characters Saturday, July 17th.

I wanted to share a few of my personal favorite Clays so far, but in all reality I like almost all of them! There is no particular ranking order in the Claymates shared below.

### There are so many more Claymates!
I've only given you a small sample of the much larger collection of the Claymates family and there are much more to come in the future. 

Feel free to check out what they're up to on Twitter [here @The_ClayMates.](https://twitter.com/The_ClayMates)

Until next time take care!
