The [Atomic Heroes](https://theatomicheroes.com) is a science fantasy action adventure with characters created based on elements of the periodic table. Stories, games, and childrens books are part of the long-term goals of the project. Several years of hard work has already been put into this and the artwork is fantastic. The unique intellectual property of Atomic Heroes could be a perfect recipe for a fun metaverse world in the future. I'd love to see that come to life!

There are currently two art collections being released as NFTs for both Atomic Minions and separately Atomic Heroes. There's also already one book published called "Atomidex".

### A few examples of the Atomic Minions Art Collection
Here are a few samples of art from the Atomic Minions Art Collection I like, but there will ultimately be 10,000 Atomic Minions when the collection is fully sold.

### Atomic Heroes Art Collection
Many art collectors are eagerly waiting for the first release of the Atomic Heroes Art Collection which is expected to drop in Q3 of 2021. This will most likely coincide with the rollout of smart contracts with Alonzo.
