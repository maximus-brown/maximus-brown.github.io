The way we discover and look at art from artists around the world could be on the verge of a huge shift to visiting virtual galleries like [this one](https://www.artsteps.com/view/60d92d3d7c2f53a86aa07ada) created by [@AdaLoverNFT](https://twitter.com/AdaLoverNFT) . Nice work putting this collection of Cardano NFTs together! 

To get a taste of what I'm talking about check it out by tapping on the image below. Please be patient while the gallery loads all the images, it might take a little time. Technology and internet speeds will need to be improved quite a bit in the future for virtual galleries to really take off, but I do believe it will happen.

The art piece above is actually my favorite so far in this gallery and it was created by [Yassin Hassan](https://twitter.com/CnftHassan). Love this artist's work. 

A few things I don't yet like about virtual art galleries and metaverse worlds is how slow it can be to walk around. It can be a little frustrating at times waiting for the browser window to load images. In fact, I think there needs to be a huge boost in dowload times. Hopefully the continual rollout of 5G will help. 

That being said, I'm a believer this will someday be how most art collectors and people in general explore art galleries for enjoyment and buying art. There are no boundaries or limitations on how an artist can share their work and how they can be viewed virtually. 

### Limitless Ways To Create Virtual Galleries
As of right now art galleries appear to mostly be in closed type of environments in buildings and/or rooms, but I'm looking forward to seeing more galleries that are totally in open metaverse worlds like space and visiting planets! Maybe hopping onto a space ship to travel from one galaxy to another.

Until next time, take care!
