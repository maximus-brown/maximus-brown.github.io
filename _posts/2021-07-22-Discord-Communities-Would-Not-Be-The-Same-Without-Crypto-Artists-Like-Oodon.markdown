It was only just three months ago when I started learning about cryptos for the first time and getting plugged into Discord communities to learn more about Cardano NFT projects. Coming in I really had no expectations of what the journey would be like and in fact I wasn't sure my interest would last long.

In this very early stage of exploring projects I would notice some servers having #fan-art sections where artists not part of the original creators team would freely share their own artistic spin and hybrid of original character designs.

For example, the artwork above by [@itsoodon](https://twitter.com/itsoodon) is a clever way to include the success of achieving a Level 10 status for one of your [SushiBytes](https://www.sushibyte.io) when playing their new blockchain battle game.

To get to Level 10 is a big deal given how much time and effort is involved by players to get there. Once smart contracts are offially rolled out with the Alonzo release they have exciting plans for game enhancements and developments. 

Here's another one by Oodon that combines two projects into one art piece including [SushiBytes](https://www.sushibyte.io) and [Yummi Universe](https://yummiuniverse.com).

Seeing this type of fan art in Discord communities puts a smile on my face during days that otherwise can seem not so bright given the troubles many are facing in around the world we live in today. 

These fan artists get inspired by something they see and selflessly spend time creating their own version for fun. And sharing their work freely to the community for enjoyment. 

Typically CNFT projects already have amazing artists, designers, and creators. But, they of course don't have all the time in the world to experiment with creating unlimited and fun prototypes of their original ideas in art form. 

That's where fan artists come in! It keeps people engaged during gaps of silence when creators are working hard on rolling out new drops and/or features. 

## How Oodon got into creating fan art
Before getting into fan art Oodon was doing random art and posting his work on Instagram. Then he started using Twitter a lot more after he started investing in some crypto currencies, and that is when he stumbled across some interesting Cardano NFT projects like [Yummi Universe](https://yummiuniverse.com) and others.

I'm a big fan of [Yummi Universe](https://yummiuniverse.com) art. Above is another fan artpiece by Oodon of the project. 

And here's another random piece of art I absolutely love, but it's not part of any projects I've been following the Cardano community.

In Oodon's own words...

> Other than having fun drawing the characters in my own style, I enjoy engaging with the community from the different projects! Everyone is so friendly and encouraging which really motivates me to create more.

## Long-term Aspirations for Oodon
One of Oodon's long-term goals as an artist is to be able to inspire others, especially the younger generation to start doodling and drawing. 

What a wondering thing to have that as an important part of your aspirations. I would attest you've already started to do that with some of your work in the community now!

He also wishes to eventually be able to start a project or collection of his own. Let's give him support and help get you there as fast as we can!  

Thank you so much for sharing your work with the community and adding positive vibes to this exciting new space! Keep up the great work and we're looking forward to what you have next.
