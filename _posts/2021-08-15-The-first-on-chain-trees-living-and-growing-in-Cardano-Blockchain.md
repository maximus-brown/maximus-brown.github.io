Creativity in new projects keeps on coming! [@CardanoTrees](https://twitter.com/CardanoTrees) has built the first on-chain trees living and growing in Cardano Blockchain.

Yes, that's right. All code and art are written on the blockchain entirely and the art itself dynamically changes over time.  

## Let's take a look at the Demo Tree
Before we dive further into the project I highly recommend watching the animatated [demo](https://pool.pm/386707e1dd9ae353a49480c576a680266e48737be00c1515ec3e715d.CTDemo04) on Pool.pm in the link shared below.

This demo tree shared by the creator has super accelerated growth to show the evolution, but the actual CNFTs in the future will move at a much slower pace. Not only that, each tree has a set of geographic coordinates that behave based on the time of day the coordinates are located around the world.

Simply beautiful right! I was struggling to put into words all aspects of this masterpiece. Showing only static images of the project wouldn't do justice to the full experience of the art. 

Below are some tree designs he's working on for an upcoming CNFT drop that hasn't been announced yet.

## Seasons and Weather Conditions
Not only do these NFTs change based on time of day, but also time of year with seasonality. Rain and thunder clouds, snow, snowflakes, sunshine, and more. I love it! And it's all stored in 4KB of code.

## Each point in time is never the same
At any given point in time the art changes and will never be the same. Sometimes you might see flowers, fruits, or even see the tree shrink based on seasons. They all live on the blockchain forever. 

## Real trees will be planted for each minted CNFT
For each CNFT minted there will be a real tree planted in the world. I love this idea and we desperately need more projects like this!

## Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain
I couldn't have said this better about the efficience of Cardano's blockchain technology. Damain's quote is below.

> Because Cardano is a low power consumption blockchain, it's a beautiful place to growth nature in it!!!

## Conclusion 
In summary, what's quite unique about this project is they aren't static images, gifs, or videos. These trees are growing on the fly and entirely stored as code on the blockchain. That means hosting art files to reference in IPFS, but the artist did include that information in case anyone wanted to take a look

Until next time, take care!
