[Nguyên's](https://twitter.com/SaL_Art_CNFT) story of how she became an artist and her background history is quite inspiring.  

Born in 1990 in Southern Vietnam, Nguyên's hometown was a poor but peaceful province with many green paddy fields and big lakes. She always loved to read and she wrote her first poem in 1st grade.

In the 6th grade she started writing her first short stories and grew up among books and nature. 

In her free time now she enjoys exploring new roads and new fields, which seems fitting given her imagination and creativity shown in her unique artwork like the one shown below.

> I think the time in that small village gave me deep impressions and marked many unforgettable memories in me. 

Living in Saigon for about 12 years, she wrote short stories, poems and started 3 novel projects. One of them went to more than 230,000 words and I have numerous loyal readers on my fan page. 

Nguyên continued on to say that...

> I love drawing too. I often bought watercolor sets, sketching papers, brushes in the bookstore and drew at home. About two years ago, I decided to enroll in a drawing course. The course looks like a small workshop with just 6 sessions, each session lasted 2 hours. I have learned some simple but important knowledge about drawing there. After that course, I enrolled in 2 courses, all in a short time and at a very basic level. 

My personal favorite art piece she's created so far is this one [here.](https://pool.pm/4758e4bcd716624c50c8de758205002ca3eea2f2be16f7e42761175d.SaLArt002)

Covid happened, the classes had to stop. In the isolated time at home, my partner told me about Cardano and CNFT. He has deep knowledge about them. Everything I knew were drawing. So I drew, and my partner took care of all the technical issues for me. He always said that I could get success in this new subject, and my art would be appreciated in this community. Truly at first, I doubt that, because I didn't have officially training in art. But I listened to him and started to draw some pieces on our iPad. The artwork is how I look at the world through my eyes. I draw them with my instinct.

I nearly didn't believe in my ears when hearing my first piece was sold. We sent the first nft in happiness. Then the second, the third,... more and more art pieces were sold and one day I had a special collector who bought a few pieces at once and told her friends about my work. I had more buyers and made some good sales. Until now, I have about 178 pieces on my website and 115 of them were sold. Some collectors bought 8 - 10 pieces at once. I also received so much support from the community. Many times I feel like I am one of the luckiest creators in this space and I am so grateful for that. 

As I shared on my Twitter before, thanks to CNFT, I could help my two nephews with their school fees. My sister runs a small breakfast restaurant and because of covid, it had to close for more than 3 months. She was very touched and quite surprised knowing the money I gave her was from my artwork. 

I think I am blessed a lot to be here, doing my artwork and being loved by many nice people. I still don't have much knowledge about blockchain or the ecosystem, I just love my creative job and the community so much. There's plenty of support and love and encouragement here. 

💜

Well, I think that's the answer for the bio and how I got into 
CNFT. There're some questions left, I will continue write to you on tomorrow. Because English is not my first language so I write slowly.
Thank you so much for reading my story and giving me a chance to tell it. 🙏 💜
