[Nguyên's](https://twitter.com/SaL_Art_CNFT) story of how she became an artist and her background history is quite inspiring. 

### Background History
Born in 1990 in Southern Vietnam, Nguyên's hometown was a poor but peaceful province with many green paddy fields and big lakes. She always loved to read and she wrote her first poem in the 1st grade.

She started writing her first short stories in the 6th grade and grew up among books and nature. 

### Now in her free time
Now in her free time she enjoys exploring new roads and new fields, which seems fitting given her imagination and creativity shown in her unique artwork like the one shown below.

> I think the time in that small village gave me deep impressions and marked many unforgettable memories in me. 

Living in Saigon for about 12 years, she wrote short stories, poems and started 3 novel projects. One of them went to more than 230,000 words and I have numerous loyal readers on my fan page. 

Nguyên continued on to say that...

> I love drawing too. I often bought watercolor sets, sketching papers, brushes in the bookstore and drew at home. About two years ago, I decided to enroll in a drawing course. The course looks like a small workshop with just 6 sessions, each session lasted 2 hours. I have learned some simple but important knowledge about drawing there. After that course, I enrolled in 2 courses, all in a short time and at a very basic level. 

My personal favorite art piece she's created so far is this one [here.](https://pool.pm/4758e4bcd716624c50c8de758205002ca3eea2f2be16f7e42761175d.SaLArt002)

Then the unforgettable Covid pandemic happened and her classes had to stop. In the isolated time at home her partner told her about Cardano and CNFTs.

His deep knowledge about the Cardano blockchain and inner workings of the community helped tremendously with allowing Nguyên to start minting some of her unique 1/1 art pieces as CNFTs.

While he took care of technical aspects and issues, Nguyên continued to focus purely on drawing.

> He always said that I could get success in this new subject, and my art would be appreciated in this community. Truly at first, I doubted that, because I didn't have officially training in art. But I listened to him and started to draw some pieces on our iPad. The artwork is how I look at the world through my eyes. I draw them with my instinct.

She nearly didn't believe in her ears when hearing her first piece was sold. They both sent the first NFT in happiness.

>Then the second, the third,... more and more art pieces were sold and one day I had a special collector who bought a few pieces at once and told her friends about my work. I had more buyers and made some good sales. 


She also received so much support from the community. Many times she feel like she's one of the luckiest creators in this space and so grateful for that. 

### Tough times for her family during Covid
During Covid her loving sister had to close down her breakfast restaurant for more than 3 months, but Nguyên's success was already been enough to help pay for her two nephews with their school fees.

When Nguyên's sister heard the news she was very touched and quite surprised knowing the money she gave her was from her artwork. 

> I think I am blessed a lot to be here, doing my artwork and being loved by many nice people. I still don't have much knowledge about blockchain or the ecosystem, I just love my creative job and the community so much. There's plenty of support and love and encouragement here.
