The time has finally come for holders of CNFTs to enjoy their collections as wall art! [Nano Frames](https://twitter.com/NANO_Frames) is the first project of its kind in the Cardano community that's creating digital frames and it's much needed. 

Up until this point in time the most beautiful art being created by artists on the Cardano blockchain has had limited utility in terms of wall art, at least for most folks with the exception of a few who are technically savvy enough to know how to build digital frames using a Rasberry Pi.

I'm looking forward to a day in the future when more people are interested to buy NFTs because of aesthetics and beauty rather than purely for a quick flip.  

Nano Frames gets us closer to that and I'm thrilled they've decided to take the leap.

### Cardano Wallet Connection
Their vision is for collectors to connect their wallet with the Nano Frames app that allow you to pick which NFTs you'd like display in the digital frame.

The most used Cardano wallets are planned to be supported including Nami Wallet, Daedalus, AdaLite, and YOROI.

### Initial frame sizes and color options
Frame sizes in the first product release will be 10.1 inches, 21.5 inches, and one square frame at 22 inches.

There will be 5 color options to choose from for the outer part of the frame.

### Technical Specs
All frame sizes will have the ability to control through the app, however there are some differences in other aspects like resolution, anti-glare screen, mount, headphones, and speaker output.
