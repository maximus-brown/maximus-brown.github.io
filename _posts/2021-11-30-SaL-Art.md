[SaL's](https://twitter.com/SaL_Art_CNFT) story of how she became an artist and her background history is quite inspiring and touching. 

First off, if you'd like to just hop right into her projects here you go.

### Background History
Born in Southern Vietnam, SaL's hometown was a poor but peaceful province with many green paddy fields and big lakes. She always loved to read and wrote her first poem in the 1st grade.

She started writing her first short stories in the 6th grade and grew up among books and nature. 

### Now in her free time
In her free time now she enjoys exploring new roads and new fields, which seems fitting given her imagination and creativity in her unique artwork like the one shown below.

> I think the time in that small village gave me deep impressions and marked many unforgettable memories in me. 

Living in Saigon for about 12 years, she wrote short stories, poems and started 3 novel projects. One of them went to more than 230,000 words and she has numerous loyal readers on her fan page. 

SaL continued on to say that...

> I love drawing too. I often bought watercolor sets, sketching papers, brushes in the bookstore and drew at home. About two years ago, I decided to enroll in a drawing course. 

The course looked like a small workshop with just 6 sessions, each session lasted 2 hours. She learned some simple but important knowledge about drawing during her courses there. 

Soon after she enrolled in 2 more courses, all in a short time and at a very basic level. 

My personal favorite art piece she's created so far is this one [here.](https://pool.pm/4758e4bcd716624c50c8de758205002ca3eea2f2be16f7e42761175d.SaLArt002)

### Then the unforgettable happened
Then the unforgettable Covid pandemic happened and her classes had to stop. In that isolated time at home her partner told her about Cardano and CNFTs.

His deep knowledge about the Cardano blockchain and inner workings of the community helped tremendously with allowing SaL to start minting some of her unique 1/1 art pieces as CNFTs.

While he took care of technical aspects and issues, SaL continued to focus purely on drawing.

> He always said that I could get success in this new subject, and my art would be appreciated in this community. Truly at first, I doubted that, because I didn't have official training in art. 

But she listened to him and started to draw some pieces on their iPad. The artwork is how she looks at the world through her eyes. 

> I draw them with my instinct.

She nearly didn't believe in her ears when hearing her first piece was sold. They both sent the first NFT in happiness.

>Then the second, the third,... more and more art pieces were sold and one day I had a special collector who bought a few pieces at once and told her friends about my work. I had more buyers and made some good sales. 

The community gave her enormous support early on and she's felt like one of the luckiest creators in this space, and so grateful for that. 

### Tough times for her family during Covid
During Covid her loving sister had to close down her breakfast restaurant for more than 3 months, but SaL's success was already been enough to help pay for her two nephews with their school fees.

When SaL's sister heard the news she was very touched and quite surprised knowing the money she gave her was from her artwork. 

> I think I am blessed a lot to be here, doing my artwork and being loved by many nice people. I still don't have much knowledge about blockchain or the ecosystem, I just love my creative job and the community so much. There's plenty of support and love and encouragement here. 

### What are you most excited about with your project and Cardano?

> All written below is a direct quote shared from SaL

What made me enjoy most about my project is that my creativity can be unlimited. I love it when I'm drowning in making some paintings. The process is just so awesome and I could do it all day. 

I can be myself when doing art, I can express my own stories, my feelings or even my dreams, my illusions through art pieces. Every time I work, I feel eager and delighted as the first time I got into it. Drawing and writing make me happy every day. 

What made me excited about Cardano is that the community is very friendly and supportive. I have met many kind and nice collectors, who truly have deep connections to my art and have given me so many encouragements and kind words. 

Making good sales is good, but having deep connections and being truly appreciated is better. I love that when a collector bought my “salon-spa” sketches piece to give to his Mom as a gift because “she has spent countless hours in Salons to make sure the lights stayed on”, he said, “your art means more to me than anyone will ever know”. 

Or another collector bought a pink piece to give to his partner because she loves pink. Some collectors said that my pieces speak to them… All of that things really touch me and make me grateful a lot.

### What do you enjoy most about your work and commitment in creating your art?

> All written below is a direct quote shared from SaL

I have had big happiness when my nft has raised $5300 for Child Abuse and Neglect Children. After that, I was very surprised to receive back 10% perpetual returns from NFT Rescue Foundation Inc. 

I'm really glad to be one of the very first artists involved in this business model. Then I decided to give back 50% of my artist royalties towards [HealthyChildren.org](https://healthychildren.org/) through NFT Rescue.

I have been wanting to do charity/ good things for social but I didn’t have many chances, and CNFT helps me do that. In the present, I give a small donation every month to SOS villages Viet Nam too. 

I love that when I could give back or contribute some little things to the world. My art could help me do it. I don’t have any huge vision or mission for the future, I just do my best in creating art and hope that I could contribute more. 

Every day I wake up excited to have many good things to do: learn new things, make new art, write my novel, spend time with family and talk to collectors and friends. That’s the life that I dreamt about.

### Thank you SaL!
SaL, thank you so much for spending time out of your busy schedule to chat with me and let me get to learn a little more about who you are! 

I'm wishing many bright years ahead full of new ideas and enjoyment in creating inspiring art.
